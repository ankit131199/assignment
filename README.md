// Explanation for working of network quality assignment.

The parameters for the function maxNetworkQuality are a radius value and a vector of tower information (towers). Within the specified radius, it determines the maximum network quality coordinate.

The code initialises two variables: maxCoordinate, which stores the coordinates corresponding to the maximum network quality, and maxQuality, which keeps track of the highest network quality so far discovered.

The code then uses nested for loops to iterate over the x and y coordinates from 0 to the specified radius (inclusive). These stand for potential evaluation coordinates.

The code initialises totalQuality to 0 for each coordinate (x, y), which will hold the total signal quality from all reachable towers at that point.

The code initialises totalQuality to 0 for each coordinate (x, y), which will hold the total signal quality from all reachable towers at that point.

The code then used a range-based for loop to cycle through each tower in the towers vector. It derives the x-coordinate (xi), y-coordinate (yi), and quality factor (qi) for each tower.

Using the Euclidean distance formula, the code determines the distance (d) between the current tower and the coordinates (x, y): d = sqrt((xi - x) * (xi - x) + (yi - y) * (yi - y)).

The tower is regarded as approachable if the distance d is less than or equal to the specified radius. The signal quality (signalQuality) for that tower is determined by the code using the formula signalQuality = floor(qi / (1 + d)), and it is then added to the totalQuality.

After iterating over all towers for the current coordinate (x, y), the code checks if the totalQuality is greater than the current maxQuality. If it is, the maxQuality is updated, and the maxCoordinate is set to the current coordinate (x, y).

In the case where the totalQuality is equal to the current maxQuality, the code compares the maxCoordinate with the current coordinate (x, y) lexicographically. If the current coordinate is lexicographically smaller, the maxCoordinate is updated.

Once all the coordinates within the radius are evaluated, the code returns the maxCoordinate, which represents the coordinate with the maximum network quality.

Overall, the code explores all possible coordinates within the given radius and calculates the network quality for each coordinate based on the reachable towers. It keeps track of the maximum network quality and the corresponding coordinate and returns the result.
